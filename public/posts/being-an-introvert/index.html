<p>My first taste of understanding the definition of introversion came from <strong>Susan Cain</strong> after listening to her Ted talk (video below). By the way, if you haven&rsquo;t read her book <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking</em>, please give it a read, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU2j0TM4" title="The power of introverts"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/c0KYU2j0TM4/0.jpg" alt="The power of introverts"></a></p>
<p>Till then, I was asking myself as why am I different. After listening to her, I started appreciating the gift of being an introvert. The only reason for writing this article is to share my learning journey of understanding introversion and do my bit to spread awareness about being an introvert.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying, it is not your fault. In fact, if you look positively, it is your biggest strength. Unfortunately, we live in a world which is extroverted and appreciates someone being loud and outward. Introversion is often looked upon as a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Every one and then, you get unsolicited advices from people around you asking you to change the way you are. The reason they give you for such advice is, world around you doesn&rsquo;t appreciate calm and quiet individuals. You have to make noise to get noticed. Well, I got similar advices many times. I have only one answer to all those poeple, being an introvert is not a disease. In fact, our brains are wired differently than our extroverted counterparts. Once you understand this fact, you won&rsquo;t provide unnecessary advices.</p>
<p>Ok, enough of ranting. Let me quote few people who are introverted but made real big in life and quietly making their way through this noisy world. I hope this will give you enough courage to appreciate who you are truly.</p>
