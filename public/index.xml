      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bore you with the technical definition of introvert. Rather, I would like to take you through a journey of how an introvert thinks, feels, works which makes you ponder over what is it being an introvert.
My first taste of understanding the definition of introversion came from Susan Cain after listening to her Ted talk (video below). By the way, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, please give it a read, you won&amp;rsquo;t regret it.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered why you weren’t able to concentrate in a class?
Your thoughts wander about everywhere from plants, water droplets, sky, milky way, universe….. the moment you start listening to a lecture. Generally, people have different levels of concentration. Few people could concentrate for 10 min and few people could concentrate for hours together. This brings us to a point, what makes us different? I would say, it’s all about how our brains are wired.</description>

      <description>To answer simply, Data Visualization Engineer is someone who knows how to present data and story tell to drive the point home.
Let’s discuss what skills one should have to enjoy being in this role:
  When you look at data especially messy data, your eyes should lit up and your fingers should start working already to clean and process data at hand.
  When someone explains a problem, you kick start the process by doing research.</description>
