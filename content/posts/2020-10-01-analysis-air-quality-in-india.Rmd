Let's explore air quality data of India. This dataset has daily pollutant readings for the period 2015-2020. 

**Goal of this analysis:**

- Understand how is the trend of these pollutants over the years

- How are the two-tier cities coping up with the increased level of infrastructure development and vehicular pollution due to increased of human migration.



**Source of the Data:**

https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india?select=city_day.csv

**Process of calculating air quality index:**

### About the Dataset:

- The dataset has air quality readings of major India cities for the period 2015-2020.

- This dataset captures the air quality parameters of PM2.5, PM10, Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ammonia (NH3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3), Benzene,
Toulene, Xylene.

- Computed Air Quality Index included in the dataset

- Population estimates of these cities were collected separately and added to the dataset to understand the role of population on air quality.

### Load Datasets

Load **Pollution** and **Population Estimates** datasets.

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Load pollution data
pollution <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learning-monk/datasets/master/ENVIRONMENT/Indian_cities_daily_pollution_2015-2020.csv', 
                      stringsAsFactor=FALSE, na.strings=c(""))

# Load population estimates data
pop_est <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learning-monk/datasets/master/ENVIRONMENT/cities%20with%20population%20estimates%202019.csv',
                   stringsAsFactor=FALSE)

```

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Let's see the structure of the dataset
str(pollution)
```

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Convert date column to Date format
pollution$Date <- as.Date(pollution$Date)
```

**Merge population estimates and pollution datasets into a Combined dataset**

```{r class.source="myCode"}
combined <- merge(pollution, pop_est, by = "City")
str(combined)
```

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Convert newly added columns to factors
combined$State <- as.factor(combined$State)
combined$Part_of_India <- as.factor(combined$Part_of_India)
combined$Metropolitan_Area <- as.factor(combined$Metropolitan_Area)
```

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Convert City and AQI_Bucket to factor variables and Date column to Date
combined$City <- as.factor(combined$City)
combined$AQI_Bucket <- as.factor(combined$AQI_Bucket)
combined$Date <- as.Date(combined$Date, format = '%Y-%m-%d')

# Add Month and Year to combined
combined$Month <- as.factor(format(combined$Date, '%b'))
combined$Year <- as.factor(as.numeric(format(combined$Date, '%Y')))

# Re-order Month Values
combined$Month <- factor(combined$Month, levels = c('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep',
                                                     'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'))
str(combined)
```

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Find missing values in the dataset
na_count <-sapply(combined, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
na_count <- data.frame(na_count)
na_count
```

Except **City** and **Date** columns, rest of the columns have **NAs.** Let's not impute these missing values as they are not evenly missing. We will ignore these values in the plots for now.


```{r class.source="myCode"}
# Re-order bucket values in logical order in AQI_Bucket columns
combined$AQI_Bucket <- factor(combined$AQI_Bucket, levels = c('Severe', 'Very Poor', 'Poor', 'Moderate',
                                                               'Satisfactory', 'Good'))
```

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# How is AQI_Bucket distributed?
table(combined[!is.na('AQI_Bucket'), 'AQI_Bucket'])
```

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=6, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Plot the distribution of AQI levels
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(subset(combined, !is.na(AQI_Bucket)), aes(x=AQI_Bucket)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
    labs(x = 'Air quality levels', title = 'Distribution of Air Quality levels') +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=6, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Using treemap, let's visualize Air quality status
# install.packages('treemapify')
library(dplyr)
library(treemapify)

AQI_nona <- na.omit(combined[, c('City', 'Date', 'AQI_Bucket')])

treedata <- AQI_nona %>%
                count(AQI_Bucket)

ggplot(treedata, aes(fill = AQI_Bucket, area = n, label = AQI_Bucket)) +
    geom_treemap(show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_treemap_text(colour='white', place='centre') +
    labs(title='Air quality levels') +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```


As different pollutants are measured on different scales and their range of values are fluctuating, it is important that we scale their values so that they can be brought under a common range and can be compared with each other in the same visualization.

**How is *Scaling/Normalization* different from *Standardization*?**

**Scaling** doesn't change the distribution but only changes the range of values. Whereas **Standardization** is a technique used to normalize underlying distrbution so that machine learning algorithms / statistical tests which assumes data to be normal can be applied.

In our case, let's scale our pollutant measurements to the range of `0 to 1`. This process makes comparison easy and also helps us in plotting all the pollutants in a single chart to see the changes over the years. The downside of this technique in contrast to `Standardization` is we will end up with smaller standard deviations which can suppress the effect of outliers.

There are lot of scaling techniques available for use. In our case, let's use **MinMax Scaler.**

**MinMax Scaler:**

- Retains the shape of the original distribution
- Doesn't change the information in the data
- Doesn't effect outliers
- The default range is 0 to 1


### Scaling our data

Each pollutant measurement is brought to a common scale of 0 to 1 so that comparison would make sense.

```{r class.source="myCode"}
pollutants <- c('PM2.5', 'PM10', 'NO', 'NO2', 'NOx', 'NH3', 'CO', 'SO2', 'O3', 'Benzene', 'Toluene', 'Xylene')


# Copy combined dataset to a new dataframe
scaled_data <- combined

# Get min value from each pollutant column
getMin <- c()
for (p in pollutants) {
    getMin <- c(getMin, min(scaled_data[,p], na.rm=TRUE))
}

# Get max value from each pollutant column
getMax <- c()
for (p in pollutants) {
    getMax <- c(getMax, max(scaled_data[,p], na.rm=TRUE))
}

# This code will loop through each column value to compute scaled value
for (i in 1:nrow(scaled_data)) {
    for (p in 1:length(pollutants)) {
        if (!is.na(scaled_data[i,pollutants[p]])) {
            scaled_data[i,pollutants[p]] <- (scaled_data[i,pollutants[p]] - getMin[p])/(getMax[p]-getMin[p])
        } else {
            scaled_data[i,pollutants[p]] <- NA
        }    
    }
}

summary(scaled_data[,pollutants])
```

**Standardization:**

The below code normalizes our pollutant columns by subtracting `mean` from each value and dividing by `standard deviation` so that the data is normalized and takes the shape of bell curve.

```{r class.source="myCode"}
# The code below standardizes the pollutant measurement data (by subracting mean and divide by standard deviation)
pollutants <- c('PM2.5', 'PM10', 'NO', 'NO2', 'NOx', 'NH3', 'CO', 'SO2', 'O3', 'Benzene', 'Toluene', 'Xylene')

# Copy pollution data to a new dataframe
standardized_data <- combined

# Compute mean of each of these pollutant columns
mean_list <- c()
for (p in pollutants) {
    mean_list <- c(mean_list, round(mean(standardized_data[,p], na.rm=TRUE),2))
}

# Compute standard deviation of each of these pollutant columns
sd_list <- c()
for (p in pollutants) {
    sd_list <- c(sd_list, round(sd(standardized_data[,p], na.rm=TRUE),2))
}

# This code will loop through each column value to compute normalized value
for (i in 1:nrow(standardized_data)) {
    for (p in 1:length(pollutants)) {
        if (!is.na(standardized_data[i,pollutants[p]])) {
            standardized_data[i,pollutants[p]] <- (standardized_data[i,pollutants[p]] - mean_list[p])/sd_list[p]
        } else {
            standardized_data[i,pollutants[p]] <- NA
        }    
    }
}

summary(standardized_data[,pollutants])
```

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, Metropolitan_Area==1), aes(x=PM2.5, y=PM10, color=City)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title="PM2.5 Vs PM10 by City") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

The two variables **PM2.5** and **PM10** are positively and strongly correlated. There are visible outliers.

### Scatter plot matrix:

Let's visualize correlation between different pollutants using scatter plot matrix.

**What is a scatter plot matrix?**

A scatter plot matrix is collection of scatter plots displayed as a grid. 

- It is similar to *correlation plot* but instead of displaying correlations, displays underlying data.
- Scatter plot matrix is created using `ggpairs` function from `GGally` package.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)


corr_df <- scaled_data %>%
                select(PM2.5, PM10, CO, NOx, SO2)

ggpairs(corr_df) +
    labs(title = 'Understanding relationship between PM2.5, PM10, CO, NOx and SO2')


```

- Except PM2.5 and PM10 rest of the pollutants plotted above have weak positive correlation among themselves Whereas PM2.5 and PM10 are strongly positively correlated above 0.8.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)

corr_df <- scaled_data %>%
                select(Benzene, Toluene, Xylene)

ggpairs(corr_df) +
    labs(title = 'Understanding relationship between Benzene, Toluene, Xylene')


```

- `Benzene` and `Toluene` shows somewhat stronger positive relationship correlation coefficient above `0.7`.

### Let's see the distribution of pollutants over the years by City.

We will use **Violin plots** for this purpose.

***What are Violin plots?***

Violin plots are similar to `kernel-density plots` but are mirrored and rotated 90 degrees.

To understand more about Violin plots, check this interesting blog:

### Distribution of PM2.5 by City over the years 2015-2020

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Distribution of PM2.5 by City over the years 2015-2020
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, !is.na(PM2.5)), aes(x=Date, y=PM2.5)) +
    geom_violin(color="black", fill="red") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "PM2.5 pollutant distribution by City") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

*Cities which caught my attention with PM2.5 pollution levels close to or over 0.50:* **Delhi**, **Gurugram**, **Lucknow**, **Patna**

- Visible outliers found in **Amritsar**, **Guwahati**, **Shillong**

#### Let's see how the PM2.5 pollutant is distributed by months for each year for the above cities (Delhi, Gurugram, Lucknow, Patna)

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM2.5 by month for each year for Delhi
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Delhi' & !is.na(PM2.5)), aes(x=Month, y=PM2.5)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="dark blue") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM2.5 by month for each year - Delhi") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

***As suspected, winter (Nov, Dec, Jan) months recorded high levels of PM2.5 for Delhi***

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM2.5 by month for each year for Gurugram
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Gurugram' & !is.na(PM2.5)), aes(x=Month, y=PM2.5)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="red") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM2.5 by month for each year - Gurugram") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**Gurugram** seems to show high levels during winter. But, interestingly 2017 year showed high levels of PM2.5 during mid year.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM2.5 by month for each year for Lucknow
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Lucknow' & !is.na(PM2.5)), aes(x=Month, y=PM2.5)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="cyan") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM2.5 by month for each year - Lucknow") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**Lucknow** seems to be following similar patterns as **Delhi** with high PM2.5 during winter.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM2.5 by month for each year for Patna
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Patna' & !is.na(PM2.5)), aes(x=Month, y=PM2.5)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="yellow") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM2.5 by month for each year - Patna") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**Patna** also seems to be following similar patterns as **Delhi** with high PM2.5 during winter.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# PM2.5 pollutant yearly distribution for Delhi, Gurugram, Lucknow and Patna
ggplot(subset(combined, City == c('Delhi', 'Gurugram', 'Lucknow', 'Patna') & !is.na(PM2.5)), aes(x=Date, y=PM2.5)) +
    geom_boxplot(color="black", fill="pink") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "PM2.5 pollutant yearly distribution for Delhi, Gurugram, Lucknow and Patna") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

- The daily permissible limits of `PM2.5` is between `40 - 60`
- The `median` levels of `Delhi`, `Gurugram`, `Lucknow`, `Patna` are close to `125` which is way above the max permissible limit

### Distribution of PM10 by City over the years 2015-2020

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Distribution of PM10 by City over the years 2015-2020
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, !is.na(PM10)), aes(x=Date, y=PM10)) +
    geom_violin(color="black", fill="darkblue") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "PM10 pollutant yearly distribution by City") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

*Cities which caught my attention with PM10 levels close to and over 0.50 through the years:*

**Delhi**, **Gurugram**, **Jorapokhar**, **Kolkata**, **Talcher**.

- Interestingly metros like **Bengaluru**, **Hyderabad** seems to be consistent and median levels under 0.50 over the years.
- There are visible outliers in **Ahmedabad**, **Amritsar**, **Gawahati** and **Shillong.**

***Note: Jorapokhar in Jharkhand state and Talcher in Odisha state are not metro cities***

#### Let's see how PM10 is distributed by month over the years for the cities Delhi, Gurugram, Jorapokhar, Kolkata and Talcher

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM10 by month for each year for Delhi
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Delhi' & !is.na(PM10)), aes(x=Month, y=PM10)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="red") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM10 by month for each year - Delhi") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**PM10** is also following similar patters to PM2.5 for **Delhi** with visible increase in levels during winter months (Nov, Dec, Jan)

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM10 by month for each year for Gurugram
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Gurugram' & !is.na(PM10)), aes(x=Month, y=PM10)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="cyan") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM10 by month for each year - Gurugram") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**PM10** was recorded only for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 for Gurugram. It is following winter pattern (with high levels during winter months) as well.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of PM10 by month for each year for Jorapokhar
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Jorapokhar' & !is.na(PM10)), aes(x=Month, y=PM10)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="green") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="PM10 by month for each year - Jorapokhar") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**Jorapokhar** is also following winter pattern (with high levels during winter months) as well.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# PM10 pollutant yearly distribution for Delhi, Gurugram, Jorapokhar, Kolkata and Talcher
ggplot(subset(combined, City == c('Delhi', 'Gurugram', 'Jorapokhar', 'Kolkata', 'Talcher') & !is.na(PM10)), aes(x=Date, y=PM10)) +
    geom_boxplot(color="black", fill="blue") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "PM10 pollutant yearly distribution for Delhi, Gurugram, Jorapokhar, Kolkata and Talcher") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))

```

- Daily permissible levels of `PM10` is between `60 - 100`
- The `median` PM10 level of Delhi is over `200` which is alarming.
- The `median` levels of `Gurugram`, `Jorapokhar` and `Talcher` is over `100` which is over the permissible limit
- The `median` level of `Kolkata` is under and close to `100`

### Distribution of CO by City over the years 2015-2020

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Distribution of CO by City over the years 2015-2020
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, !is.na(CO)), aes(x=Date, y=CO)) +
    geom_violin(color="black", fill="cyan") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "CO pollutant yearly distribution by City") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

**High CO (Carbon Monoxide)** levels close to 0.50 are observed in **Ahmedabad.**

#### Let's see the distribution of CO by month for each year for Ahmedabad

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# lets see the distribution of CO by month for each year for Ahmedabad
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, City=='Ahmedabad' & !is.na(CO)), aes(x=Month, y=CO)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="cyan") +
    facet_wrap(~ Year, nrow=3, ncol=3) +
    labs(title="CO by month for each year - Ahmedabad") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

***No clear visible pattern observed***

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# CO pollutant yearly distribution for Ahmedabad
ggplot(subset(combined, City == 'Ahmedabad' & !is.na(CO)), aes(x=Date, y=CO)) +
    geom_boxplot(color="black", fill="cyan") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "CO pollutant yearly distribution for Ahmedabad") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

- The daily permissible levels of `CO` is between `2 - 4`
- The median level of `CO` for `Ahmedabad` is over `10` which is alarming.
- Visible outliers observed over `40`

### Distribution of NOx by City over the years 2015-2020

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Distribution of NOx by City over the years 2015-2020
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, !is.na(NOx)), aes(x=Date, y=NOx)) +
    geom_violin(color="black", fill="yellow") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "NOx pollutant yearly distribution by City") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**NOx levels** seems to be high for **Ahmedabad**, **Mumbai**, **Delhi** and **Patna** with levels closer or over **0.50**

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# NOx pollutant yearly distribution for Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi and Patna
ggplot(subset(combined, City == c('Ahmedabad', 'Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Patna') & !is.na(NOx)), aes(x=Date, y=NOx)) +
    geom_boxplot(color="black", fill="yellow") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "NOx pollutant yearly distribution for Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi and Patna") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

- The daily permissible levels of `NOx` is between `40 - 80`
- The `median` levels of `NOx` for these cities seems to be under `80`.
- Visible outliers observed which are over `200`

### Distribution of SO2 by City over the years 2015-2020

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE, class.source="myCode"}
# Distribution of SO2 by City over the years 2015-2020
ggplot(subset(scaled_data, !is.na(SO2)), aes(x=Date, y=SO2)) +
    geom_violin(color="black", fill="green") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "SO2 pollutant yearly distribution by City") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

**SO2** levels are high for **Ahmedabad**, **Jorapokhar**, **Patna**

```{r class.source="myCode", fig.height=6, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE}
# Distribution of SO2 over the years 2015-2020 for Ahmedabad, Jorapokhar and Patna
ggplot(subset(combined, City == c('Ahmedabad', 'Jorapokhar', 'Patna') & !is.na(SO2)), aes(x=Date, y=SO2)) +
    geom_boxplot(color="black", fill="green") +
    facet_wrap(~City) +
    labs(title = "SO2 pollutant yearly distribution for Ahmedabad, Jorapokhar and Patna") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))


```

- The daily permissible levels of `SO2` is between `50 - 80.`
- Though the median levels are less than `50`, it is important to keep an eye on this pollutant.
- There are visible outliers recorded over `80`(which is the max permissible limit).

### Let's use `plotly` to visualize PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO and SO2 over the years

I have choosen metros **Delhi**, **Hyderabad**, **Bengaluru**, **Chennai** for indepth analysis.

***Note: You may double click on the legend values to filter a particular pollutant***

```{r class.source="myCode", fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
# Major Pollutants in Delhi over the years (2015-2020)
#install.packages("plotly")
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)

del <- scaled_data %>%
        filter(City == 'Delhi')


fig <- plot_ly(del, x=~Date) %>%
        add_lines(y = ~PM2.5, name="PM2.5", visible=T) %>%
        add_lines(y = ~PM10, name="PM10", visible=T) %>%

**Observations: Mumbai Pollution levels**

- **PM2.5:** Peaks observed during Jan 2019 and Jan 2020.
- **PM10:** Peaks observed during Jan 2019.
- **NOx:** Missing values observed during the period mid 2016 till end of 2017. Abnormal peaks observed during mid 2016 before values went missing.
- **CO:** Peaks observed during the end of 2018 and starting 2019.
- **SO2:** No visible abnormal peaks observed. Levels seems to be consistent.

**Observations: Hyderabad Pollution levels**

- **PM2.5:** PM2.5 levels are abnormally high during 2015 & 2016 and came under control in the subsequent years. There are visible peaks only during these years.
- **PM10:** PM10 levels are high during winter months of each year. There is an abnormal peak during the year 2017.
- **NOx:** NOx levels started off on a high note in 2015 but reduced gradually. There were high levels during winter and early months of 2017 till 2020 dipping during mid years.
- **CO:** CO level seems to be high during 2015 and 2016. There is one abnormal visible peak recorded during the end of 2016. After that abnormal peak, levels seems to be low will end of 2017. From 2018, levels are more or less consistent.
- **SO2:** SO2 levels were high from late 2016 till early 2017. From 2018, levels seems to be more or less under control.

**Observations: Bengaluru Pollution Levels**

- **PM2.5:** Visible peaks observed over the years and levels seems to be high during winter of each year
- **PM10:** PM10 levels were recorded from late 2015. PM10 levels are following similar patterns as PM2.5 with elevated levels during winter months of each year.
- **NOx:** Looks like NOx levels were not recorded from late 2016 till late 2017. High peaks observed during early 2016. Levels dipped past early months of 2020.
- **CO:** CO levels were high between 2015 and 2016 and largely under control after 2016 except for few inconsistent visible peaks here and there.
- **SO2:** SO2 levels were high between 2015 to 2016 and largely under control post 2016.
