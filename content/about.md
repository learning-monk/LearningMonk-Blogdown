Experienced Data professional passionate about visualizing data and drawing useful insights. I enjoy working with every aspect of data. Messy data makes my fingers work faster on the keyboard.

I work with diverse visualization tools and keep adding new tools to my arsenal. This knowledge on tools helps me pick right tool(s) for the data at hand.
